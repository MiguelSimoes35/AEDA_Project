## Algorithms and Data Structures
### Tennis Court Rental Management System

This is a project for Algorithms and Data Structures, a 2º year unit from the Masters in Informatics and Computing Engineering course at FEUP. It consisted in creating a data structure for a tennis court rental company with a simple UI. The goal was to store the information about clients, teachers, courts and technicians in a given data structure (ex. vectors, BST, Hash Tables, etc.) as well as the scheduled classes and free uses. A intuitive and simple UI had to allow the user to perform the basic CRUD operations to each element.
